{"page_num": 5, "content": "Services\nAdvertising\nThe Company\u2019s advertising services include various third-party licensing arrangements and the Company\u2019s own advertising\nplatforms.\nAppleCare\nThe Company offers a portfolio of fee-based service and support products under the AppleCare\u00ae brand. The offerings provide\npriority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement\nservices, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage and/or theft and loss, depending on the\ncountry and type of product.\nCloud Services\nThe Company\u2019s cloud services store and keep customers\u2019 content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and\nWindows personal computers.\nDigital Content\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store\u00ae, that allow customers to discover and download applications\nand digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade\u00ae, a game subscription\nservice; Apple Music\u00ae, which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+\u00ae, a\nsubscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+SM, which offers exclusive original content.

The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers,\nsmall and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its\ndirect sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network\ncarriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2021, the Company\u2019s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution\nchannels accounted for 36% and 64%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price\ncompetition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short\nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of\nthe Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating\nthe Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal\ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative\nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and\naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 2"}
{"page_num": 6, "content": "The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables\nand accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have\nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings\nwith large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products\nand a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut\nprices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products\nat little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company\u2019s services compete with business models that provide content to users for\nfree and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition\nas competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the\nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in\nAsia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s\nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products,\nservices and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing\nproducts and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d), licensing of\nintellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices,\naccessories, software and services. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of\nintellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such\nintellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the\nCompany relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is\ncurrently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio\nof issued patents, including utility patents, design patents and others. The Company also holds copyrights relating to certain\naspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019s\nproducts. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its\nproducts.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include\nintellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various\naspects of the Company\u2019s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such\nlicenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future\non reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 3"}
{"page_num": 7, "content": "Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in\npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of\nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect\ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an\nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and\ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated, and dedicated team, and is committed to supporting the development of all\nof its team members and to continuously building on its strong culture. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had\napproximately 154,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is committed to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex,\nsexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, veteran status, caste or other legally protected characteristic. The\nCompany is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should not only be competitive; it should be equitable and should enable employees\nto share in the Company\u2019s success as shareholders of the Company. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to\nthrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal\nlives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits to employees around the world.\nGrowth and Development\nThe Company invests in tools and resources that support employees\u2019 individual growth and development. The Company also\nprovides classes and seminars to foster understanding and critical thinking about the Company\u2019s culture, organization and\nvalues.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company is committed to hiring inclusively, providing training and development opportunities, fostering an inclusive culture,\nand ensuring equitable pay for employees, and is continuing to focus on increasing diverse representation at every level of the\nCompany.\nThe Company has initiatives in place to implement its commitment to increase diverse representation, including creating diverse\ninterview panels and candidate slates, focusing on robust diversity recruiting efforts, and expanding diversity outreach efforts\nthrough organizations that serve and engage talent from underrepresented communities. The Company also offers team\nmembers access to ongoing inclusion and diversity education, and support throughout their career journey and helps them find\ncommunity and connection through employee groups that create spaces for belonging, learning, and growing inclusivity, diversity\nand equity efforts.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leadership fosters an open,\ncollaborative work environment where everyone can participate, develop and thrive. Team members are encouraged to come to\ntheir managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company regularly conducts surveys that gauge employee\nsentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its employees everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential risks\nassociated with workplace activities in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports\nemployees with general safety training and puts specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard\nenvironments, including chemical management, laser safety, equipment and machinery safety, hazardous materials\nmanagement and electrical safety. The Company has taken additional measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, including\nproviding information resources, testing, face masks and personal protective equipment, and case support. The Company also\noffers special sick leave for employees with possible COVID-19 symptoms, as well as comprehensive health coverage.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 4"}

{"page_num": 9, "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company\u2019s stock,\ncan be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or\nmore of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial\ncondition, as well as the price of the Company\u2019s stock, can be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition,\npast financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not\nuse historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking\nstatements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial\nStatements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company\u2019s stock, have\nbeen adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to\ntake unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations,\ntemporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times\nsignificantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the\nfuture materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of\nthe Company\u2019s stock. During the course of the pandemic, certain of the Company\u2019s component suppliers and manufacturing and\nlogistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide, and similar\ndisruptions could occur in the future. The Company\u2019s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, have been\ntemporarily closed at various times. In many cases, as stores and points of sale have reopened, they are subject to operating\nrestrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers. The Company has at times required\nsubstantially all of its employees to work remotely.\nThe Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and\nrequirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company\u2019s operational and\nfinancial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company\u2019s control, including the timing,\nextent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and\neffectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on\nthe global economy and demand for consumer products. Additional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not\nlimited to, material adverse effects on demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, the Company\u2019s supply chain and sales\nand distribution channels, the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company\u2019s profitability and cost structure.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and\nstock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and\nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\u2019s supplier facilities, including\nmanufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to\ntrade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations\ncan materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and\nspending can be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate\nand mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs\nand other economic factors.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 6"}

Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain\ncredit to finance operations and purchases of the Company\u2019s products; and insolvency.\nA downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade\nreceivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue\nnew debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial instruments. These and other economic\nfactors can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism,\nnatural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents\nand other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular\nnetwork carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international\ntrade. Trade and other international disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict international trade\nand can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of\ntariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost\nof the Company\u2019s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely\nimpact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company\u2019s products more expensive\nfor customers, which could make the Company\u2019s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also\nadopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the\nCompany\u2019s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These\nmeasures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships,\nand ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company\u2019s operations in accordance with new or\nchanged trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and distracting to\nmanagement. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to\neffectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international\ndisputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness.\nMany of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract\nmanufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and\nfacilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial\naccidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health\nissues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Global climate\nchange is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can\nmake it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and\ninefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service\nofferings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant\nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the\nsupply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any\nnegative consequences to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While\nthe Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur\nand could result in disruption to the Company\u2019s business and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Major public health issues,\nincluding pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the\nCompany due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public\nsafety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products\nbetween regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of\nthe supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to\ncover all losses that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 7"}

The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the\nCompany must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected\nreturns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to\nregister, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete\nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on\nits intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the\nCompany operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if\ncompetitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be\nadversely affected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces\nsubstantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other\nresources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the\nCompany\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices.\nCompetition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain\ncompetitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of\nthe markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications\nwithin their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also\nexpects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their\nofferings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and\nexperience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models\nthat provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content\nand applications.\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to\ncontinually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the\nCompany will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\nBusiness Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions\nand transitions of products and services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must\ncontinually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate\ncustomer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and\nupgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors,\nincluding timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with\nproduction ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company\u2019s products, the effective management of\npurchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate\nquantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or\nother defects or deficiencies.

{"page_num": 12, "content": "The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing\npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in\nAsia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in\nsingle locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these\narrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such\ndiminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products\nmanufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although\narrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally\nremains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences an\nunanticipated product defect liability from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of\nconduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many\ncomponents, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s\nhardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of\ncomponents or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be\ndisrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial\ndisputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade\ndisputes.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners,\nand has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements\nhelp ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial\nproblems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of\nmanufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\ncommercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant\nsupply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to\nindustry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high\ndemand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company\u2019s ability to\nobtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has\nentered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or\nrenew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can\nlead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain\nsufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic\nconditions on the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201cThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on\nglobal and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition,\u201d above, can also affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components.\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially\nadversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product\nuses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing\ncapacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any\nnumber of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components\ncustomized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. When the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product has\nbeen delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the\nCompany\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints\ncould materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.

Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues\nthat can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in\ncomponents and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\u2019s products\nunsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company\u2019s\nproducts are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company\u2019s service offerings can have\nquality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company\u2019s services from\ntime to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the\nCompany will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can\nresult in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, the Company\ncan be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant\nand equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory\nfines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in\nharm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\nservices, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase\ncommitment cancellation risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated\ndemand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for\norders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its\nsuppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be\nrecoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which\nthe carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory\nprepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company\nwill not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence\nin the industries in which the Company competes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments.\nManufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for\nperiods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price\nchanges, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components\nor products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires\nlicenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently\ncompetes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the\nCompany\u2019s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to\ntime, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nBased on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally\nbe obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such\nintellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or\notherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party\nsoftware applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain\nsoftware applications and services for the Company\u2019s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be\ndeveloped and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the\ndevelopers\u2019 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services\nfor the Company\u2019s products compared to competitors\u2019 platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for\npersonal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms.

Some third-party content providers\nand distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or\nimpossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may\nseek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a\nwide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for\ntalent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company\u2019s customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused\nadditional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions.\nIf requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions.

Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company\u2019s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor\nperformance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and\nseverance costs.\nThe Company\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the\nCompany\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse\neffect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company\u2019s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store\nconstruction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the\nvalue of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable\nresults of legal proceedings or government investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary\ncourse of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements\nentered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and\ndamages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government\ninvestigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations,\nhas generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and\nnew claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents\nand seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual\nproperty rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as\ninternationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be\nexpensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these\nconsiderations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges.\nThere can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These\nagreements can also significantly increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to\nchange its business practices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services.\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form\n10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading\n\u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a\nmaterial loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other\nclaims.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 13"}
{"page_num": 17, "content": "The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against\nthe Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s\nresults of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an\noutcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits,\nremedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and can require the Company to change its business\npractices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to\ncover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust;\nprivacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; product liability;\nintellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; Internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications;\nmedia, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment;\nanticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti\u2013money laundering;\nforeign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, and climate\nchange.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting the Company\u2019s global\noperations. Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business by increasing the Company\u2019s costs,\nlimiting the Company\u2019s ability to offer a product or service to customers, requiring changes to the Company\u2019s supply chain and\nbusiness practices or otherwise making the Company\u2019s products and services less attractive to customers. The Company has\nimplemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no\nassurance the Company\u2019s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies\nand procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that\nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may\nnot be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory\nscrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market\nand legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the\nproposed EU Digital Markets Act, could, if enacted, require further changes. These changes could include how and to what\nextent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in\nlegal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact\non the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of\ninvestigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse\nfindings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its\nApp Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s\nbusiness practices, and may in the future result in further changes.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become\nsubject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s\ncommercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of\noperations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies\nto offer their search services on the Company\u2019s platforms and apps, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to\ngovernment investigations and legal proceedings.\nThere can be no assurance the Company\u2019s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by\nthe outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company\u2019s\nbusiness practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively\nimpact the reputation of the Company\u2019s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users\nof the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor\nmarket acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 14"}
{"page_num": 18, "content": "The Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations\nregarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of\nvarious types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict\ntransfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws\nin this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These\nlaws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing\nrequirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to\nchange its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information\nprovided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to\ncomply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations\ncould result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational\nimpacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the\nCompany is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health\ndata, financial data and biometric data. Health data is subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements,\nand the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company\u2019s compliance with these obligations. If\nthe Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted\nby law or under the Company\u2019s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government\ninvestigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\nFinancial data, such as payment card data, is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations,\nif cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can\nalso incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company\ncould also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it\nfails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business,\nreputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example,\nthe gross margins on the Company\u2019s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross\nmargins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global\nproduct pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased\ncompetition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product\nlife cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and\ndelivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively;\nshifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory\nchanges require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the\nintroduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors\ncould have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in\npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of\nsales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a\ndecline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to\nunexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new\nproduct or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the\nCompany\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative\nto local currencies.\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated\nsales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on\nproducts that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency\nexchange rate fluctuations.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 15"}
{"page_num": 19, "content": "The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign\ncurrency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing\ndemand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to\nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross\nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign\ncurrency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its\nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may\nincrease the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more\nthan a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the\nhedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and\neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of\nthe Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore,\nalthough the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable\nsecurities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the\nCompany\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments\nrelated to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The\nCompany also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\ncustomers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank\nsupport or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\u2019s trade receivables can be\nconcentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its\ntrade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also\nhas unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors\nthat manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments\nassociated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 25, 2021, the\nCompany\u2019s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a\nfew individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk\non its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures\nwill effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to\nadditional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the\nCompany\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and\nother non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates are\naffected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax\nassets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and\nIreland.\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\nand other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome\nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the\noutcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the\nultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 16"}

The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global\neconomic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the\nmeasures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company\u2019s business,\nresults of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company\u2019s stock.\nDuring 2021, aspects of the Company\u2019s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the\nCompany\u2019s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number\nof the Company\u2019s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened all of its retail stores and substantially all of its other\nfacilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it\ncontinues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations. During the fourth\nquarter of 2021, certain of the Company\u2019s component suppliers and logistical service providers experienced disruptions, resulting\nin supply shortages that affected sales worldwide.

{"page_num": 29, "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone\nbasis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the\nCompany\u2019s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions\nwill offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates.\nFurther, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses\nrelated to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and\noperating results.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and outstanding\ndebt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company\u2019s interest income and expense are most\nsensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u2019s cash,\ncash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and\ninterest paid on the Company\u2019s debt.\nThe Company\u2019s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company\u2019s liquidity\nrequirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and\nachieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of\nminimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment\ngrade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk\nassociated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a\nchange in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield\ncurve. Based on investment positions as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, a hypothetical 100 basis point\nincrease in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.1 billion and $3.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market\nvalue of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\nAs of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying\nmaturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $118.7 billion and $107.4 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in\nthe future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow\nthe Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate\npayments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging\ninstrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company\u2019s debt as of\nSeptember 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 to increase by $186 million and $218 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\nForeign Currency Risk\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and\nin particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in\nU.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there\nhas been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign\nexchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future\ncash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into\nforeign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency\u2013denominated\ndebt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue\nand inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign\nexchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic\ncost of hedging particular exposures.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 26"}
{"page_num": 30, "content": "To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative\npositions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to assess the potential impact of\nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random\nmarket price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given\nconfidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model\nis not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm\ncommitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of\nthe model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of\nSeptember 25, 2021, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $551 million as of September 26, 2020. Because the\nCompany uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are\ngenerally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ\nmaterially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 25, 2021 due to the inherent limitations associated with\npredicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company\u2019s actual\nexposures and positions.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 27"}

{"page_num": 37, "content": "Apple Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively \u201cApple\u201d\nor the \u201cCompany\u201d). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary\nfor fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in\nconformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period\u2019s\npresentation.\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The\nCompany\u2019s fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years,\nquarters, months and periods refer to the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and\nperiods of those fiscal years.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses\nAt the beginning of the first quarter of 2021, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (the \u201cFASB\u201d)\nAccounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain\nfinancial instruments. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of\nASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on\nthe date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest.\nFurther information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, \u201cBenefit Plans.\u201d\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (net income in\nmillions and shares in thousands):\n2021 2020 2019\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 94,680 $ 57,411 $ 55,256\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average basic shares outstanding 16,701,272 17,352,119 18,471,336\nEffect of dilutive securities 163,647 176,095 124,315\nWeighted-average diluted shares 16,864,919 17,528,214 18,595,651\nBasic earnings per share $ 5.67 $ 3.31 $ 2.99\nDiluted earnings per share $ 5.61 $ 3.28 $ 2.97\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 34"}
{"page_num": 38, "content": "The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities. Potentially\ndilutive securities representing 62 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per\nshare for 2019 because their effect would have been antidilutive.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.\nThe Company\u2019s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The\nCompany classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument\u2019s underlying\ncontractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale are\nrecognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (\u201cOCI\u201d).\nThe Company\u2019s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their\navailability for use in current operations. The Company\u2019s marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with gains and\nlosses recognized in other income/(expense), net (\u201cOI&E\u201d).\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\nInventories\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets,\nwhich for buildings is the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one and five years for machinery and\nequipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life for\nleasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the\nestimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to seven years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property\nand equipment was $9.5 billion, $9.7 billion and $11.3 billion during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNoncash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net decrease to accounts payable and other\ncurrent liabilities of $2.9 billion during 2019.\nRestricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities\nThe Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The\nCompany reports restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current or non-current\nclassification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company reports restricted marketable securities as current\nor non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative\ngains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred\nin accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (\u201cAOCI\u201d) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged\ntransaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as\ncash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it on a\nstraight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates.\nChanges in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to\nthe change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company\nexcludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it in OI&E on a straight-line\nbasis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are\nrecognized in OCI.\nGains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges\nare recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative instruments relate.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 35"}
{"page_num": 39, "content": "The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The\nCompany classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash\nFlows.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair values of the Company\u2019s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in\nactive markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company\u2019s debt instruments\nand all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market\nprices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\nNote 2 \u2013 Revenue Recognition\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue\nat the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is\ngenerally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of\nownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\u2019s Products net sales, control\ntransfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are\ndelivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or\ncommencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer\nincentive programs based on the Company\u2019s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d).\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are\nestablished that reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone,\nMac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated\nsales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to\nreceive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud\u00ae, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the\nright to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with\neach device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative\nSSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is\nbased on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized\nwhen control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the\nproduct-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis\nover the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software,\nincluding estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled\nservices and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized\nrevenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of\nthe product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For\nthird-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company\u2019s other digital content\nstores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company\naccounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\nThe Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities,\nwith the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 36"}

The Company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit\nexposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.\nHowever, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to,\naccounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the\nhedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts,\noption contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally\nhedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to\n12 months.\nTo protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments.

The Company generally does\nnot require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain\ninstances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit\ninsurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-\nfinancing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company\ngenerally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nAs of both September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or\nmore of total trade receivables.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the\nCompany for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated\nthe application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be \u20ac13.1 billion, plus interest of\n\u20ac1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the\nEuropean Union (the \u201cGeneral Court\u201d). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25,\n2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to the European Court of Justice.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts\nand expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 28, 2021\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 54"}

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined\nin Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 25, 2021 to provide reasonable\nassurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is\n(i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and\n(ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the Company\u2019s assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s\ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a\ncontrol system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative\nto their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of\ncontrols in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nbusiness conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company\u2019s\nassessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 25, 2021\nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with GAAP.
