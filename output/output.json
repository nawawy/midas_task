{"page_num": 35, "content": "When used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units when installed and equipment sales at time of delivery. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding operating leases). \u201cDays sales outstanding\u201d is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. \u201cDays payable outstanding\u201d is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. \u201cDays of supply\u201d is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant period's deliveries and using trading days.

{"page_num": 35, "content": "Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management\u2019s internal comparisons to Tesla\u2019s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla\u2019s performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla\u2019s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above.", "category": "Financial Reports"}
